Project Description
The project uses historical air quality data to train machine learning models for predicting future air quality. The models take into account various features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and previous air quality readings to make accurate predictions.

Objectives
Predict air quality indices such as AQI (Air Quality Index) or pollutant concentrations.
Explore and preprocess the dataset to improve model performance.
Implement and compare different machine learning algorithms.
Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
Data
The dataset used for this project contains historical air quality data along with meteorological information. It includes features such as:

Date: The date and time of the reading.
Temperature: The temperature at the time of the reading.
Humidity: The humidity level at the time of the reading.
Wind Speed: The wind speed at the time of the reading.
Pollutants: Concentrations of various pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, etc.
AQI: The Air Quality Index, if applicable.
Data Source
[Provide a link to the dataset or describe where the data can be obtained.]

Machine Learning Models
The following machine learning models are used in this project:
